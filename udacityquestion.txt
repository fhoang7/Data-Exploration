I'm taking a look at billionaire average ages over the year range from 2004-2007.
I'd like to produce a line graph for each country that tracks the change in average age of a billionaire over that time.
I don't know where to go from here after transposing. I know that I want to convert all the data into individual observations and then facet wrap by country.
Would love some help on where to go from here.
